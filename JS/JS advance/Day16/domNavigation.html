<!-- The entire document is a document node
Every HTML element is an element node
The text inside HTML elements are text nodes
Every HTML attribute is an attribute node (deprecated)
All comments are comment nodes -->
<!-- 
With the HTML DOM, all nodes in the node tree can be accessed by JavaScript.

New nodes can be created, and all nodes can be modified or deleted. -->

<!-- 
Node Relationships
The nodes in the node tree have a hierarchical relationship to each other.

The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships.

In a node tree, the top node is called the root (or root node)
Every node has exactly one parent, except the root (which has no parent)
A node can have a number of children
Siblings (brothers or sisters) are nodes with the same parent -->

    <title>DOM Tutorial</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>DOM Lesson one</h1>
    <p>Hello world!</p>

<!-- 
From the HTML above you can read:

<html> is the root node
<html> has no parents
<html> is the parent of <head> and <body>
<head> is the first child of <html>
<body> is the last child of <html>
and:

<head> has one child: <title>
<title> has one child (a text node): "DOM Tutorial"
<body> has two children: <h1> and <p>
<h1> has one child: "DOM Lesson one"
<p> has one child: "Hello world!"
<h1> and <p> are siblings -->


<!-- 
    Navigating Between Nodes
You can use the following node properties to navigate between nodes with JavaScript:

parentNode
childNodes[nodenumber]
firstChild
lastChild
nextSibling
previousSibling -->

<!-- 
The nodeName property specifies the name of a node.

nodeName is read-only
nodeName of an element node is the same as the tag name
nodeName of an attribute node is the attribute name
nodeName of a text node is always #text
nodeName of the document node is always #document -->

<!-- 
The nodeValue property specifies the value of a node.

nodeValue for element nodes is null
nodeValue for text nodes is the text itself
nodeValue for attribute nodes is the attribute value -->
